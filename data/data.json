My project is to elucidate the role of PBRM1/BAF180 loss in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in order to identify potential therapeutics that can exploit PBRM1 loss in RCC. Before coming to NCI, I completed my dissertation at UNC Chapel Hill. There, I developed an expertise in epigenetics, specifically with chromatin remodeling and the SWI/SNF complex, as evidenced by my publication record. I demonstrated that SNF5 inactivation dramatically alters the composition of the SWI/SNF complex and prevents the formation of specific complexes required for cellular differentiation. Thus this may be a potential mechanism of development of malignant rhabdoid tumors. Molecular Toxicology from UC Berkeley.\n",
